### Build Ultra-Modern Web Apps with Angular Material [(link)](https://www.toptal.com/angular-js/ultra-modern-web-apps-angular-material)

#### Summary

At the Google I/O Conference back in 2014, Google announced Material Design, their new design language. They have since converted much of their popular applications to adhere to this new spec in an effort to provide a consistent experience. Now they are trying to convince you to follow along as well.

### A Dynamic Hierarchical Web-based Portal [(link)](https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=4554&context=etd)

#### Summary

A dynamic hierarchical web-based portal was created to house a suite of webbased supply chain management applications. The portal was designed in a hierarchical manner to match the structure of large companies. Administrators of the the portal have the ability to form the portal in such a way to mimic the existing structure of their company. Access rights to the applications in the portal may be granted or denied per division and the users of the portal are placed in these divisions based on their duty in the company. In addition, users are granted roles which dictate their ability to modify how the portal behaves. This thesis covers the client-side portion of the portal which includes the user interface and several client/server interfaces. The client-side was built with the Adobe Flex SDK and the Flash Builder 4 IDE, which connects to a ASP.NET MVC 3 back end and a MSSQL database. The code was internationalized to be able to plug in a localized language resource file. Unit tests were written with FlexUnit to test the code before deployment.
